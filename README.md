# Instructions to run the code:
1. Dataset images should be in 3 folders, Stone, Tumor and Normal
2. Create a folder called preprocessed-x in each of the above mentioned folders where x is the category- normal, tumor or stone
3. Run each of the MATLAB files and change path as required
4. The intermediate outputs will now be stored in processed-x for each category/class
5. Store each of the processed-x folders in a separate folder and name the parent folder as categories. This will be the input for our CNN
6. Run kidney-and-tumor-detection.ipynb (works well on google colab)
